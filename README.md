# Event-Driven Programming with Qt

This repository contains a practical assignment focused on allowing students to practice event-driven programming concepts within a computer system. The primary objective of this project is to provide hands-on experience with event-driven programming through the development of a graphical user interface application using the Qt framework (https://qt.io) in C++.

## Project Overview

The project revolves around creating an application that utilizes the Qt framework to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) that responds to various events triggered by user interactions. The application aims to demonstrate the principles of event-driven programming, showcasing the power and versatility of the Qt framework.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure that you have the Qt framework installed on your system. You can download it from https://qt.io and follow the installation instructions for your platform.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
`git clone <repository-url>`


3. Explore the project files and structure to understand the different components of the application.

4. Build and run the application using the provided build scripts or by importing the project into Qt Creator and using its built-in tools.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **src**: This directory contains the source code of the event-driven application developed using C++ and the Qt framework.

- **docs**: Here you will find any relevant documentation, such as user guides, diagrams, or design specifications for the application.

- **resources**: This directory may contain any additional resources required by the application, such as images, icons, or sample data.

## Usage

1. Compile and build the application using the provided build scripts or the integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

2. Run the application and interact with the graphical user interface to experience the event-driven programming in action.

3. Modify, extend, and experiment with the code to explore different event-driven scenarios and UI interactions.
